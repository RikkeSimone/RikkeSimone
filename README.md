### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a bubbly and kind person who absolutely loves software development, and enjoy the little woohoo moments we get when a solution has been found to yet another problem! I Recently graduated from Enspiral Dev Academy, and I am ready to take on a new role as a Junior Software Developer within an agile and supportive environment. I am a qualified JavaScript/Node.js/React full stack developer, however, I think the beauty of IT is how rapidly the industry changes and I canâ€™t wait to expand my knowledge even further.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finalising a pack walk adventure website and will be starting on my virtual CV and a PCOS-HUB (health hub) soon!
